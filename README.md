# The Order of Champions

The Order of Champions is a Dungeons and Dragons 5e Shared Campaign. Play with different characters, across different landscapes, and with different dungeon masters. You can play a regular weekly game or mix things up in pick-up games with different players.

### New to Shared Campaigns?
**What is a Shared Campaign?** Shared D&D campaigns share the same rules, restrictions, storylines, and standards. They can be played with any group of players, any DM, and across countless adventures using this shared framework.

**Our Setup.** Ours is made up of a Council (policymakers), various Moderators (community champions), DMs (that run games), and the player-base that journeys through the campaign world. We are a community-driven campaign â€” feedback is always welcome and often solicited before settling on important rulings.

**Multiple Characters, Same Universe.** In our shared campaign, you can make as many characters as you want, and there's a lot of allowed sources to draw from. Each new character starts at level one (tier one), and session difficulty is determined by how many characters are in the party and the average level.
