Reward for Others: NA
Your Reward: Enhanced Character Creation Options

**Previous Name (AL Season 7)**: *Complete Season!*

**Requirements**: Earn **Alpha through Omega**, **There and Back Again**, and either **Epic Win** or **Master and Commander** Quest Rewards for every storyline of an *Order of Champions* season. Because *Adventurers' League* epics cannot be legally run, this reward is only possible for *Order of Champions* seasonal storylines.

**Reward**: Choose one of the following rewards:

- **A single character** of your choice, either newly created or already existing, receives a +4 to the point buy pool for their attributes. The character in question may be rebuilt to accommodate this addition, regardless of level.
- **ALL of your characters**, existing and new, receive a permanent +1 to the point buy pool for their attributes.
- You may **petition the Administrators** for a homebrew modification to a single character. This may take the form of an existing modification or be something of your creation. The Council will, at its discretion, grant a certification to allow this modification.

**Reward for Others**: The glory of knowing a Supreme Champion!
