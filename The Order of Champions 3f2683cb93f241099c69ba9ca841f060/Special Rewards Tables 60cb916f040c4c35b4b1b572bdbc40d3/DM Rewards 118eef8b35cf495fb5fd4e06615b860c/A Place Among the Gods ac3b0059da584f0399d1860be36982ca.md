# A Place Among the Gods

Prerequisites: 0 Hours DMing for the OoC Campaign
Requirements: DM your first OoC session
Reward for Others: The DM who recruited you: Increasing the Pantheon Quest Reward
Your Reward: 1000 XP

**Previous Name (AL Season 7)**: *Initiate*

**Requirements**: Run your very first *Dungeons and Dragons* session, with a runtime of two hours or greater, that complies with all *Order of Champions* campaign standards and requirements.

**Prerequisites**: You must not have earned the *A Place Among the Gods* reward previously. (Note that earning its predecessor reward, *Initiate*, for the Adventurers League does not disqualify you from earning it "again" for our campaign.)

**Reward**: 1000 XP.

**Reward for Others**: The DM who recruited you into the *Order of Champions* shared campaign earns the **Increasing the Pantheon** Quest Reward. If you were not recruited by anyone, or if the person who recruited you does not DM for our campaign, then you may select a "mentor" from among those who do DM. In return for their agreement to mentor you, this reward will be granted to them.
