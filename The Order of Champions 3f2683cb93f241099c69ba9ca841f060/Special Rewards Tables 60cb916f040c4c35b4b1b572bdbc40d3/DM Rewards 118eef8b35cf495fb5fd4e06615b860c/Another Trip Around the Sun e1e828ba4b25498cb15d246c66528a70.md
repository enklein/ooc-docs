# Another Trip Around the Sun

Prerequisites: A Place Among the Gods Quest Reward
Requirements: Have a Birthday
Reward for Others: Your players: +20% to Rewards Cap for adventures during birthday week
Your Reward: Gain XP (see description)

**Previous Name (AL Season 7)**: *Level Up!*

**Requirements**: Experience a birthday. Note that this does not need to be your *actual* birthday; it can be the anniversary of the day you joined the campaign or another special date. However, once selected, the same date must be used in perpetuity.

**Prerequisites**: **A Place Among the Gods** Quest Reward.

**Reward**: Gain XP according to the following algorithm: 100 x Number of Years Playing D&D x Number of Storylines DM'd.

For the purpose of determining "number of storylines DM'd", each unique module prefix will be considered a separate storyline, and running three modules with that prefix will satisfy the requirement of counting that storyline in the tally.

**Reward for Others**: For any game run within seven days of your birthday, the maximum XP and GP for any mission DM'd by you is increased by 20%. Note that this is ***possible rewards only***; the DM should still adjudicate rewards granted based on the conditions at the table.
