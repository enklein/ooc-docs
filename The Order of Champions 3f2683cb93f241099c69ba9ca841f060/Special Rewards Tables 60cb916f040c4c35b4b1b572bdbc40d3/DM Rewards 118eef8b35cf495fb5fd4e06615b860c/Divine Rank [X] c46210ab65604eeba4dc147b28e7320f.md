# Divine Rank [X]

Prerequisites: N/A
Requirements: 24 Hours DM Time
Reward for Others: The DM who recruited you: 3000 XP multiplied by X
Your Reward: Variable (see description)

**Previous Name (AL Season 7)**: *Dedicated DM*

**Requirements**: This achievement is earned every time your total runtime of *Order of Champions* legal sessions reaches a variable of twenty-four (24) hours. Each time this occurs, the value of X is increased by 1 (for example, someone obtaining a total runtime of forty-eight (48) hours would earn the **Divine Rank 2** Quest Reward.

**Prerequisites**: None. Note that each time you earned the old reward *Dedicated DM* counts as having earned this reward for the purposes of determining the value of X. Also, if a former *Adventurers League* DM transfers to our campaign, then hours spent DMing for the Adventurers' League **before the transfer** will count towards this total.

**Reward**: Your reward is dependant on your Divine Rank...

- **Ranks 1-5**: You may claim one tier-appropriate magic item for one of your characters. The item must be the standard reward for one of the sessions that you have DM’d before.
- **Ranks 6-10**: As above, but the item may also be the standard reward of any non-hardcover adventure, even if you have not DM’d the module in question.
- **Rank 11+**: As above, and in addition to obtaining this item, you also obtain two different potions or scrolls of your choice from Magic Item Tables A-D. Your choices for these potions and scrolls are NOT restricted to tier appropriate items. (The magic item still is.)

Note that magic items earned for this reward are "generic" versions of the item, and contain no flavor enhancements or designs from the module's version of the item.

**Reward for Others:** Your mentor/recruiter DM receives 3000 XP, multiplied by the value of X. This reward requires your consent, and should only be granted if they have maintained an active hand in helping and guiding you through your DMing adventures.
