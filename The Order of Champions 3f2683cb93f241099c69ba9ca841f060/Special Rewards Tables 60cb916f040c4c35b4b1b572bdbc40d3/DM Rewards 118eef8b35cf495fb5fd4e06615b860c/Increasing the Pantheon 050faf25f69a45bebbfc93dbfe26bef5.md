**Previous Name (AL Season 7)**: *Zealot of Oghma*

**Requirements**: Convince someone to run their very first *Dungeons and Dragons* session, with a runtime of two hours or greater, that complies with all *Order of Champions*campaign standards and requirements.

**Prerequisites**: The recruit must not have earned the *A Place Among the Gods* reward previously. (Note that earning its predecessor reward, *Initiate*, for the Adventurers League does not disqualify you from earning it "again" for our campaign.) You, conversely, must have a minimum of two (2) hours of runtime for *Order of Champions* legal sessions.

**Reward**: 7500 XP.

**Reward for Others**: The DM you recruited or agreed to mentor gains the **A Place Among the Gods** Quest reward.
