# Everything in Life is Location

Prerequisites: N/A
Requirements: DM at a new venue
Reward for Others: Session Event: Travelling Priest
Your Reward: Increase totalrewards by 100%

**Previous Name (AL Season 7)**: *Traveler*

**Requirements**: DM for the first time in one of the following venues:

- A New Internet Protocol
- In a Home (In-Person)
- A Specific Gaming Store
- A Specific Convention

**Prerequisites**: You must not have run an *Order of Champions* legal session at the venue in question before. For gaming stores and conventions, this means the specific site. For Internet Protocols, this means a completely new program (a different discord server, for example, would not count, but the first time using discord *at all* would count).

A particular session can only count once for this reward. For example, your first time using both *Discord* **and** *Roll20*would only entitle you to this reward once, even if done at the same time.

**Reward**: Increase your total experience, gold, downtime and renown rewards for the session by 100%. This is applied after all other rewards are calculated.

**Reward for Others**: The characters during the session can, at a time of your choosing, come upon a wandering priest who can provide spellcasting services for them at the usual cost. Choose 3 spells of 2nd level or lower from the cleric or druid spell list and add them to the priest's list of spellcasting services. If the party contains anyone with the *Acolyte* background, the priest is of an allied faith for at least one of them and is willing to offer those characters one spellcasting service free of charge (the character only pays the cost of any expensive material components for the chosen spell).
