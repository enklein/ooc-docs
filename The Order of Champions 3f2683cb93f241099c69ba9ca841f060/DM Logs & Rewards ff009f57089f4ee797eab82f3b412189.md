# DM Logs & Rewards

All Order of Champions Dungeon Masters (DMs) must have an up-to-date logsheet with a record of sessions ran, DM rewards allotments. Optionally, you might find it convenient to also maintain current totals (minus expenditures) for Experience Points (XP), Gold (GP), Downtime (DT),  Renown, and hours played.

**Session Records**. You must include the adventure title (with module number), the date DMed, the length of the session (hours), any magic items unlocked or granted to characters, and DM XP, GP, DT, and Renown.

- The XP, GP, DT, and Renown rewards can be 'pooled' and allotted to characters as you would like or immediately assigned to a specific character when you record the session's rewards.
- See below for calculating DM rewards for sessions ran.

**DM Rewards Allotments**. When transferring any DM rewards earned, you must log how much of each resource is transferred, the date the transfer was made on, and the character receiving the resources.

**DM Rewards**. We also grant special DM rewards for certain achievements.

## Tools for Character Logs

[**Character/DM Log Sheet on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uPwiRwPuB_jXYKDFLlIZylbyMn6SUeP5t23eex8qunU/edit?usp=sharing).** Make a copy and replace the data with your own (or recreate the table your preferred tool).

**[Adventurer's League Log](https://www.adventurersleaguelog.com/)**. This tool was made for AL but can be used for OoC DMs with a few small tweaks.

# Calculating Basic DM Rewards

You receive the same downtime and renown rewards as the characters at the table. For gold, you receive 30% of your experience reward in gold pieces. For experience, the reward is dependent on the number of players per session:

- **For 3-4 Player Groups**. You receive experience equal to the *minimum* granted for the APL of the mission.
- **For 5 Player Groups**. You receive experience equal to the *average* granted for the APL of the mission, rounded up to the nearest 10 XP.
- **For 6-7 Player Groups or 2 Player Solo Modules**. You receive experience equal to the *maximum* granted for the APL fo the mission.

You can modify the basic DM rewards received as a result of any special rewards earned during the session. See the page linked below.
