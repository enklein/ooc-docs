# Downtime

There are several activities you can do in your downtime (expending downtime days and the gold required to maintain your character's lifestyle for each day of downtime spent).

## Purchasing Magic Items

You can purchase unlocked magic items during your downtime. Read more about it in our Magic Item Purchasing guide.

## Alliance Activities: Tool Proficiencies, Magic Items, and Mentorship

As you rank up in your alliance, downtime activities like learning tool proficiencies, acquiring magic items, and mentorship become available. Read more about it in our Alliances (Factions) guide.

## Trading Magic Items

Permanent non-unique magic items of Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, and Legendary categories may be traded between characters. Trades must be one item for one item of the same rarity.

- Each participant must spend 15 downtime for each transaction unless both characters are participating in the same module at the time of the trade.
- Each participant must record the details of the trade in their logsheets as noted in our Character Logs & Rewards guide, including the item involved, the name of the player and character (with DCI if they have one), the character they are trading with (yours), and any specific variable details that are unique to the item or relevant to the trade.

## Copying Spells (Wizard)

Wizards in the OoC must spend downtime days to copy spells into their spellbook, as per the "Your Spellbook" sidebar on p.114 of the PHB and the "Spell Scroll" entry p.200 of the DMG.

One downtime day allows up to 8 hours of copy time into their spellbook. Wizards in the same party can simultaneously engage in this downtime activity to effectively trade spells. This downtime activity can be conducted either in our #bot-commands channel with a DM supervising (ping staff so we are aware) or during play with DM supervision since rolls may be required and failure is a possibility.

- Spells copied must be of at least 1st Level and of a level you can prepare.
- The process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp *per spell level.*
- When a spell is copied from a *spell scroll*, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

## Tiering Up

You are permitted to jump the last level of a tier by spending downtime, from:

- **4th to 5th level**: 20 days
- **10th to 11th level**: 100 days
- **16th to 17th level**: 300 days

You must be of the last level of your current tier in order to jump to the first level of the next tier, and you gain the minimum necessary XP to tier up.
