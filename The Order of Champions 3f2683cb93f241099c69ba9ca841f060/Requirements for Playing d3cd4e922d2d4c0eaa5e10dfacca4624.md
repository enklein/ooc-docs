# Requirements for Playing

There are a few things you need to get started:

- **Access to the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Rules.** Ideally, a copy of the *Player's Handbook*, but there's also a free [Basic Rules](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules) set that has all of the essentials.
- **A Character Sheet.** The backbone of any healthy character, a character sheet helps you keep track of abilities, skills, equipment, features, and more. You can build one online in various sites like [D&DBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) or [Roll20](https://roll20.net/) or find [printable PDFs](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/trpg-resources/trpg-resources). Check out our guide to [Making a Character](https://webflow.com/design/order-of-champions#) everything is OoC-legal.
- **Adventure Logsheets.** As your character progresses on their journey, you'll need to keep a log of all the gold, items, experience, and other rewards they gain or lose. Read more in our guide to [Logging for Players](http://order-of-champions.webflow.io/guides/logging-for-players).
