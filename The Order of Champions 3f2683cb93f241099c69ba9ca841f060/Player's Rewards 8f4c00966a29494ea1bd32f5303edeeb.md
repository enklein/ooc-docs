# Player's Rewards

At the end of each module, epic, or hardcover chapter, your character can receive awards including experience points, gold, downtime, renown, and magic items (or item unlocks).

# Module Rewards

**Hardcover Rewards.** Rewards you receive from hardcovers vary, but your DM will reward at the end of each session according to your party's average level, the events that have occurred during the session, and more.

**Experience Points (XP).** Experience is used to level your character. The amount of experience your character receives per module is determined by the average level of your party's members, the time the adventure typically takes, the number of players in your party, and what your party accomplishes during the adventure. Your DM will reward you experience points at the end of each session.

**Gold (GP)** is used to purchase items both magical and mundane. The amount of gold your character receives per module is determined much like the amount of experience you will receive, leaning more on what valuables and gold you are able to obtain during the adventure. Your DM will reward you gold at the end of each session.

**Downtime (DT)** is used in completing out-of-adventure activities. The amount of downtime you will receive at the end of a module is typically a standard rewards based on module length, but your DM may increase or decrease the amount based on the events taking place in your party's adventure.

**Renown** represents the fame and notoriety that your previous adventures have brought you. It can represent your character's personal fame and reputation with your Alliance, the latter impacting what rewards are open to you from your Alliance.

## Magic Items and Unlocks

Magic items are awarded at the end of the module or hardcover chapter. One character obtains the item outright and, for everyone else, the item becomes unlocked for a one-time purchase with gold pieces.

Items obtained outright from modules often have an additional special property; items purchased after being unlocked are the generic version of the item, without this additional property.

Adventures played before item unlocks were formally instituted are not unlocked. This includes adventures played before July 21, 2019, for Order of Champions original characters, and adventures played before Adventurer's League Season 8 for transfer characters from that organization.

## Banned and Untradeable Items

There are a limited number of banned and untradeable magic items as well:
