# Shadowcrafters

Faction: Harpers
Guilds: Izzet League, Simic Combine

Through a meeting between Niv-Mizzet and Elminster, the Alliance of Shadowcrafters became the first of the Five Grand Alliances. Initially comprised of the Harpers and the Izzet League, it wasn't long before the Simic Combine joined. Together, they seek to use their network of spellcasters, scientists, and spies to pursue all that can be known and to use that knowledge to further the good of their respective populations.

### Accepted Alignments

Any non-evil alignment.

### Goals

- Gather as much knowledge as possible, throughout all the planes.
- Learn through experimentation and covert means.
- Thwart any potential threats that grow too powerful.

### Member Traits

Shadowcrafters tend to perform in a range of beauty and finesse, to absolutely chaotic. The latter is due to the Izzets joining the Alliance first. The Simics, the calmer of the two joining guilds, were very interested in the Harpers pursuit of knowledge. When there isn't a rampant disregard for it, stealth is most often used for the gathering of information. With both the Simic and Izzet working together to excel in magic, the bounds of the very laws strain under their combined magical intellect.
