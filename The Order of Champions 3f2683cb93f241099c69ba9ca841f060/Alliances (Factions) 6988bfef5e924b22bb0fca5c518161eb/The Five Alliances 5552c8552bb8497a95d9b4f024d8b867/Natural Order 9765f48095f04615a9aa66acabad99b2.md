# Natural Order

Faction: Emerald Enclave
Guilds: Golgari Swarm, Selesnya Conclave

The Natural Order was created when Trostani, guildmaster of the Selesnya Conclave, reached out to the elder circle of the Emerald Enclave. Their mutual reverence of nature, coupled with the fear that the other Alliances may encroach on the wilds of their planes, led to the start of the Alliance. Soon, they brought the Golgari Swarm into the Natural Order, in hopes that their sheer numbers would help with the efforts of this Alliance.

### Accepted Alignments

Any non-evil alignment.

### Goals
