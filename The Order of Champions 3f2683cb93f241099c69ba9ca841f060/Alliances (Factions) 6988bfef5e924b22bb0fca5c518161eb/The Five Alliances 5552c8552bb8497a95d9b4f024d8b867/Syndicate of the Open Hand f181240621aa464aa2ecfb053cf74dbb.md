# Syndicate of the Open Hand

Faction: Zhentarim
Guilds: Cult of Rakdos, House Dimir

It's unknown whether the Syndicate of the Open Hand is real or a myth. Often referred to simply as "The Syndicate," it's rumored to be an alliance between the Zhentarim, House Dimir, and the Cult of Rakdos. No one knows whether it was first conceived of by the enigmatic Pereghost, the shapeshifter Lazav, or the demon Rakdos. But if it does exist, its agents vary from skilled spies and assassins to hedonistic acrobats and jugglers.

### Accepted Alignments

Any alignment.

### Goals

- Sow chaos and confusion.
- Seize power, wealth, and influence.
- Dominate the planes.

### Member Traits

The Syndicate values confidentiality. Its agents often don't know that they're working for the Syndicate, sometimes for years. Agents that do know however keep it a heavy secret. Even the chaos of the Rakdos Cultists is quelled due to the overwhelming urge of secrecy coming from House Dimir and the Zhentarim themselves. They are quick to use what they've learned to gain power and influence, often through deception, propaganda, or bribery. **Note this and The Oathsworn are the only Alliances that allow players to have Lawful Evil characters.**
