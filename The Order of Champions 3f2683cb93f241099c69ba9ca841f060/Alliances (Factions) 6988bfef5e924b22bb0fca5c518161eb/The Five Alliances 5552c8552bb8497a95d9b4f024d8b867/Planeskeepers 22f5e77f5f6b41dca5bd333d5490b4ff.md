# Planeskeepers

Faction: Order of the Gauntlet
Guilds: Boros Legion, Gruul Clans

The Planeskeepers were initially formed of an alliance between the angels of the Boros Legion and the zealots of the Order of the Gauntlet, who had a mutual interest in the security risk that the paths between planes posed. When these interplanar portals began appearing, the scattered Gruul Clans regularly came across them and were a perfect addition to this Alliance of Planeskeepers. This common goal helped Borborygmos unify the Clans once and for all.
