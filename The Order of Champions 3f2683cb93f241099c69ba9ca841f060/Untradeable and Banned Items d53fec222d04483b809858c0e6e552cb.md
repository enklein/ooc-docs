# Untradeable and Banned Items

Items banned and untradeable follow the lists below.

Players receive, unlock, and/or purchase magic items in hardcover adventures under the same terms as they do on our current magic item ruling for modules, abiding by any tier restrictions based on the item's rarity.

The council will update this list with any additional items as new adventures are released and reviewed.
