# Ruling 9: Regarding Ravnica Background Customization Options

The council has made the following determination:
Ravnica guild backgrounds are of a different breed, owing to the lore of the setting in which they are designed to inhabit. They are, essentially, analogous to both backgrounds and factions in the Forgotten Realms. On that basis, they require the following special handling: - Guild Background Names, Background Features, and Background Guild Spell Lists are irrevocably tied together. No one can choose to take any one of them without taking all three. - Those choosing Guild backgrounds may not also choose a Forgotten Realms faction. - No background spell lists are permitted which are not granted by a Guild background.
Note that this action is being taken without community input as a quick "band aid" measure; a future agenda item before this council is set to evaluate background options in their totality, and a community feedback period will be enacted at that time.
