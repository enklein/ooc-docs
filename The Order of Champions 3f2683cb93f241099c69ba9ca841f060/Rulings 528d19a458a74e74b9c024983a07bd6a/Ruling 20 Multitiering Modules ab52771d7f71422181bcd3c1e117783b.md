Date: Feb 24, 2020
Tags: Administrative, Material

The council has made the following determinations about authoring a module in order for it to be legal in The Order of Champions

- *Multiering is no longer mandatory and instead incentivized*
- *The Incentives will look like this*

    No multitiering - No reward
    2 Tiers - 250 Gold spent as a DM Reward
    3 Tiers - 250 Gold and 25 Downtime spent as a DM Reward
    4 Tiers - Award one tier appropriate magic item from the module written to one of your characters
    Note: The process for making a Module for OOC legal has not changed, just the removal of the requiredness of multitiering
