**Ruling 29: Character Death, Resurrection and Rewards**
- As a reminder to all DMs and Players, a character resurrected by Raise Dead or similar magic suffers penalties described in the spell description:
- Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a âˆ’4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
- This penalty can be removed by spending downtime days (for any purpose), or they persist into the next session the character participates in as though only 1 long rest had occurred.(edited)

**Ruling 29A: Resurrections from NPCs or party members**
For cases in which a character dies and is resurrected by an NPC or a character in the party:
- Characters receive rewards for the portions of the module they survived + the portion they died during. In calculating rewards for a character that has died in session and has been revived outside of the session, subtract experience and gold earned by the party for objectives or encounters the killed character has missed.
- If the group has completed the module, the character still earns standard downtime and renown.
- Spell casting services can be utilized during mods at a DM's discretion should the party be close by town or settlement large enough to offer those spell casting services. Doing so means that character does not count as having died for the purposes of calculating rewards.

**Ruling 29B: Resurrections from Alliances (Tier 1 only)**
A character who relies on their alliance to cast the Raise Dead spell at the end of a module, can earn xp (and only xp) as follows: 75xp per hour, up to half the minimum xp for the module's apl and the number of hours of play before the character died. The amount of xp calculated this way should be rounded up to the next 10 xp.

**Ruling 29C: Resurrections from Player Characters outside the module**
A character who dies can be revived by another character using downtime under the following circumstances:
- The casting character must be capable of casting the spell being used at the time of the PC dying.
- The character being revived and the casting character must have reason to know each other. Being in the same alliance or having played in a module together are some examples. Appeals can be made to the admin team for other reasons.
- Downtime costs are as follows if the caster must be near or touching the body- 1 day must be spent by the character being revived and at least 10 days must be spent by the character casting the spell. A total of 15 days must be spent, and the remaining four can be divided between the two characters as they see fit.
- Downtime costs are as follows if the caster does not need to be near the body- the casting character must pay 1 downtime. The character being revived may pay between 0 and 4 downtime to wait out the penalties of Raise Dead or similar magic.
- Both characters must pay lifestyle costs per downtime day spent in this way.
- The character being revived would receive rewards for the module in which they died as though they or their party had paid for Raise Dead at the end of the module. (Refer to part A of this ruling)

**Ruling 29D: Resurrection (the spell)**
Dead characters ineligible for the Raise Dead spell may forgo half their xp reward, all of their gold and downtime rewards, and forgo receiving 1 renown to spend 3k gold and have an NPC cast Resurrection on their remains.
