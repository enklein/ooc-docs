The council has made the following determinations:

- A sudden influx of dimensional gateways has linked several material planes together. All major cities in the Forgotten Realms, each district in Ravnica, an ancient grove in Barovia, and several cities in Eberron, including Sharn, now possess Portal Nexus buildings either in or near their boundaries, where people of means freely journey between the various planes for a myriad of purposes, ranging from commerce to tourism. While some locales are more wary of outsiders than others, all venues currently at least tolerate this intermingling.
- To advance their interests across these new frontiers, the main guilds of Ravnica and factions of the Forgotten Realms have aligned their interests and formed five **Grand Alliances**.
- The ***Natural Order*** was formed by a union of the *Emerald Enclave* and the *Selesnya Conclave*. Though their enthusiastic reverence for nature's darker side causes a little tension, the *Golgari Swarm* have likewise been accepted into the fold.
- The *Gruul Clans*, marginalized by their loss of stewardship in Ravnica, have taken new purpose as guardians and finders of the interplanar hotspots. Now ***The Planeskeepers***, they have joined forces with the *Order of the Gauntlet* and the *Boros Legion* to keep security between the planes.
- The ***Shadowcrafters***, a conglomerate of the *Harpers*, the *Izzet League*, and the *Simic Combine*, continue to pursue all that can be known and seek to use that knowledge to further the good of their respective populations.
- The *Lords Alliance*, the *Azorius Senate* and the *Orzhov Syndicate* have become the ***Oathsworn***, and charged themselves with ensuring order and diplomacy between the planes. They are often tasked with bringing extraplanar criminals to their home realms to face justice.
- The ***Syndicate of the Open Hand*** is the result of a dark alliance between the *Zhentarim*, the *Rakdos Cult* and the *House of Dimir*. Their ultimate reasons for working together are their own.
