# Ruling 12: Character Transfer Rebuilds

Date: Apr 29, 2019
Tags: Character Imports

The council has made the following determination:
- When transferring a character of Tier 2 or above from the Adventurer's League or Explorers' Guild, you may rebuild the character once if you so choose. Usually this would be to take advantage of a character option available in our campaign world that was not available to the character when it was originally created, but it may be done for any reason. This must be done before the character has started their third game session in our campaign world; at that point, the character is again locked in.
- Tier 1 characters remain freely rebuildable between modules, without limitation, until they begin their first Tier 2 session.
- As always, a character's name is set in stone immediately upon creation and cannot be altered.
