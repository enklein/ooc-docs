# Ruling 11: Record Keeping

Date: Apr 12, 2019
Tags: Administrative, Documentation

The council has made the following determinations:

- The basic standards of recordkeeping (players keeping logsheets of their adventures with the DM's DCI number and earned rewards) will remain unchanged.
- In recognition that further recordkeeping may be too cumbersome for some, but an enjoyable perk for others, additional recordkeeping will be available but *optional*, including:
    - Adventure Records provided with some modules for player distribution (at authors' discretion)
    - Questionnaires about module results during their "hot" period that can be submitted back to the author in order for the results at the table to impact the storyline of future seasons * A spot on our website for DMs to record their sessions
    - Players are encouraged (but not required) to obtain DCI numbers and submit them to the DM for enhanced recordkeeping.
    - It is likely that we will provide incentives in the form of Campaign Rewards for participating in these optional activities. This will be finalized when the Rewards program is overhauled for OC Season 1.
