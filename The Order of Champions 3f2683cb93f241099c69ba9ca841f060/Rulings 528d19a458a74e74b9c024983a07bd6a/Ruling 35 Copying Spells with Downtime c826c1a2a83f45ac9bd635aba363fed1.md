**Ruling 35: Copying Spells with Downtime**
Wizards in the OoC must spend downtime days to copy spells into their spell book, as per the "Your Spellbook" sidebar on p.114 of the PHB and the "Spell Scroll" entry p.200 of the DMG.

One downtime day allows up to 8 hours of copy time into their spell book. Wizards in the same party can simultaneously engage in this downtime activity to effectively trade spells. This downtime activity can be conducted either in our #bot-commands channel with a DM supervising (ping staff so we are aware) or during play with DM supervision since rolls may be required and failure is a possibility.

- Spells copied must be of at least 1st Level and of a level you can prepare.
- The process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp *per spell level.*
- When a spell is copied from a *spell scroll*, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.
