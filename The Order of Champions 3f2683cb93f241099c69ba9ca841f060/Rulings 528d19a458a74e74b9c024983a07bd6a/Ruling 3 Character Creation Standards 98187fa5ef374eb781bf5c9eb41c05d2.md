Ruling #3: Character Creation Standards
The council has made the following determination:
- The following sourcebooks are all legitimate content sources for character creation in our campaign:

- *Player's Handbook*
- *Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica*
- *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*
- *Elemental Evil Player's Companion*
- *Volo's Guide to Monsters*
- *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*
- *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*
- *The Tortle Package*

- The council continues to support the standard that all sourcebooks may be used simultaneously, without restrictions (IE PHB+1). We also encourage our authors to keep this in mind when designing NPC foes for modules.
- Eberron material is UA, and as such we are hesitant to release it without a thorough understanding of the playerbase preference. We are therefore opening that decision to a public comment period.
- The Point Buy/Standard Array variant rules presented in the *Player's Handbook* are the accepted standard for stat generation; much as we would love to include a rolling option, it is impossible to prevent abuse.
- The optional rules for Multiclassing, Feats, and the Human Variant race are all validated for our campaign.
- All other character creation rules (starting equipment, etc.) will follow the normal standard as defined in the *Player's Handbook.*
