Ruling #1: Multi-Tiering
The council ruled that this issue did not need community input, as no restrictions are being imposed on the playerbase.
The council has made the following determinations:
- Unless specific exception is granted, Multitiering will be the mandatory standard for all adventures written within our organization.
- Multitiering will follow the following scale format: "Save the Town" (Normally Tier 1) written for Tiers 1-2. "Save the Realm" (Normally Tier 2) written for Tiers 1-3. "Save the World" (Normally Tier 3) written for Tiers 2-4. "Save the Multiverse" (Normally Tier 4) written for Tiers 3-4.
During the course of debate, the issue of replay possibility came up, and was ultimately considered beyond the scope we were examining. It has been added to our queue as Motion #17.
