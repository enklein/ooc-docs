# Ruling 25: The Awaken Spell

Date: Apr 20, 2020
Tags: Gameplay

The Spell effect of "Awaken" only lasts the duration of the module in which Awaken was cast. After which, the conjured creature will leave the party, and go and return to the place they were created from. This does not affect any other spells that create creatures that players can control, such as Animate Dead. As long as spell slots are used to maintain control, the targets of these spells may be brought from module to module.
