# Ruling 16: New Legal Hardcovers

Date: Jun 25, 2019
Tags: Material

The council has made the following determinations:

- The Greyhawk Hardcover adventure, *Ghosts of Saltmarsh*, is canonically legal for our shared campaign. One of the dimensional gateways from Faerun does lead to the land of Greyhawk, and ***The Planeskeepers*** allow passage into that realm same as any other. Use HCSALT as the prefix for the adventure on your log sheets.
- It has been brought to our attention that the Explorers' Guild organization made an announcement that *Keep on the Borderlands* has been legalized in their campaign, so... just a reminder that this has always been the case for years under the Adventurers League ([https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurers_League](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurers_League)), and therefore remains legal for us. Per their prefix conventions, it is logged under the DDALK prefix. with -A through -E appended for the various parts. As per Ruling #2, all AL legal content is automatically legal for us as well, unless said content cannot be obtained legally by us (IE their epics).
- As with all material put forth anywhere, we reserve the right to make revisions and errata as we see fit to attempt an optimal play experience for everyone in the organization. If you discover something significantly imbalanced, you are encouraged to bring it to our attention.
