# Ruling 24: Ring of Spell Storing and Downtime

Date: Apr 19, 2020
Tags: Gameplay

A player can use their downtime to store spells cast by another player:
- The character with the ring and the casting character must be in the same tier.
- Downtime costs are as follows: At least 10 days must be spent by the character receiving the spell into their ring and at least 1 day must be spent by the character casting the spell. A total of 15 days must be spent, and the remaining four can be divided between the two characters as they see fit.
- Both characters must pay lifestyle costs per downtime day spent in this way.
- The cost of any material components consumed in casting the spell must be paid by the character receiving the spell.
- Spells cannot be cast into the ring from or through magic items that negate material costs.
- The NPC spells for casting included with adventure module guidance can be cast into the ring at the beginning or end of a session in discussion with your DM.
