- All existing WGE characters who have played in at least one legal OoC adventure as of January 1st, 2020 are hereby grandfathered in, and will continue to be legal for OoC play in their current forms.
- WGE characters created via DMXP who have not played an adventure prior to 1/1/20 will also be grandfathered in, provided that they have registered the characters by submitting an email to admins@dndoc.org with the character sheets.
