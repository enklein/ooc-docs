Date: Apr 27, 2020

The council's ability to grant certifications has been clarified in good faith as follows:
- Council members can modify the rewards of a session or grant a cert-reward to a player as needed excluding allowances are not OOC legal.
- All admins will log the specifics of a cert given for transparency and review by the rest of the council.
- Any cert made by an admin can be discussed and brought to a vote by the council for revocation. Should a majority vote to revoke the cert and any reward, the council member that administered the original cert will be responsible for notifying the affected parties to remove the cert's allowances.
