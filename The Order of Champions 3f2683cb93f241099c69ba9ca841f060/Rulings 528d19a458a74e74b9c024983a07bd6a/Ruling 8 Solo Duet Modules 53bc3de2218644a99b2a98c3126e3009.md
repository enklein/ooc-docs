# Ruling 8: Solo/Duet Modules

Date: Mar 22, 2019
Tags: Material

In the interest of giving our playerbase the flexibility to enjoy small group games, it is our intention to allow modules, both within our own seasonal storylines and developed by third parties, which are meant to be played by a DM and one or two players. We will explore the possibility of some regular sized modules having 'solo/duet' options as well. Each module will contain guidance on it's front page regarding how many players it is meant for.
