# Ruling 15: Suspension of Secret Mission Requirements

Date: May 17, 2019

The council has made the following determination:
- Secret missions need a closer look. Hard to find, become kinda meta, yada yada. So for the duration of Season 1, we're suspending the requirement that a character complete one to reach rank 3-5 within their alliance.
- Should we institute something later or take the suspension off, we won't just arbitrarily demote everyone who doesn't meet the new standard. We'll either grandfather it or create a grace period to bring the character into compliance. TBD next year.
