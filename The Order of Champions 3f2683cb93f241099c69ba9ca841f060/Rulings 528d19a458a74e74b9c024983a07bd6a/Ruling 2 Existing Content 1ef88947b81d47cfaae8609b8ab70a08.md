# Ruling 2: Existing Content

Date: Mar 19, 2019
Tags: Material

With a clear understanding of the community's interest in having familiar content available for play, the council has made the following determinations:
- All Adventurer's League content, past and future, are hereby deemed to be legal for our organization. This includes all CCC content, all hardcovers, and basically anything other than epics (which cannot be legalized solely because we have no legal way to obtain and host them.) Any modifications or rulings regarding the content will be detailed in our organization's documentation (content guide, DMG), same as the Adventure League does. Until and unless something is addressed by us, the AL equivalent of those documents will be considered our position as well.
- The sole Explorers' Guild module, DDEG01, is hereby deemed to be legal for our organization. Again, our content guide or DMG will detail any changes.
- Other third party modules may be legal for our organization based on a two-thirds majority vote of this council.
- The modules for our own custom seasons will, obviously, be legal for our organization.
