Date: Jul 3, 2020
Tags: Character Imports

Renown is less of a numerical concept in the more recent season of Adventurers League. To remedy this so imported charatcers won’t be at a deficit, the following ruling shall go in effect: Season 9 AL characters being copied and imported to the OoC in accordance with the guidelines set in the Player’s Guide can gain additional renown put towards their alliance of choice upon entering the OoC. The renown is equal to the amount of hardcover chapters and non-introductory missions (ie OoTA HC-01, DDAL 09-02, DDAL09-03, DDEX 02-02, etc.) they have successfully completed, as in not failing the mission, only during season 9.
