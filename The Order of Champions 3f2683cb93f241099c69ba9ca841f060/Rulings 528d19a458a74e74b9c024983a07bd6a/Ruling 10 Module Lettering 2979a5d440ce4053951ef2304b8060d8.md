# Ruling 10: Module Lettering

Date: Mar 23, 2019
Tags: Documentation

The council has made the following determination:
- The anatomy of our module codes will be as follows: [Organization][Storyline][Season]-[Module Type][Serial].
- Organization will be two letters, always "OC" for Order of Champions.
- Storyline will be two letters, including, but not limited to, "MS" for Main Storyline, or "SQ" for Side Quest.
- Season will be two numbers, incremental: "01" for Season 1.
- Module type will be one letter, including, but not limited to "S" for Solo (1-2 player), or "G" for Group (3-7 player).
- Serial will be two numbers, and will increment without regard to individual module type. For example, there will never be both an OCMS01-S02 and an OCMS01-G02.
