# Ruling 13: Final Council Organization

Date: May 6, 2019
Tags: Administrative

The council has made the following determinations:
- In a desire to ensure that a remedy exists for a rogue or absent councilor, a procedure was agreed upon for how to remove a councilor from office. As it would be largely a housekeeping matter, we are choosing to keep the details of the process internal to the council itself. We remain confident that the mechanism will not ever need to be deployed, and is there solely as a formality.
- We have chosen to elevate **@üÖ±lue‚ùå** and **@ ù“Ω…¨œÉ** to fill the two vacant positions on this council. We are excited to be able to move forward from here with our full council in place.
