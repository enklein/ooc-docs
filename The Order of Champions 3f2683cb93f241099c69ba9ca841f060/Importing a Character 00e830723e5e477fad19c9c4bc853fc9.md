# Importing a Character

We welcome players from most shared campaigns, including the Adventurers League.

# **Differences Between the OoC and Other Campaigns**

We use a ruleset similar to AL's season seven rules. Instead of collecting points in each session toward unlocks, we reward gold, one reward of the item, and an unlock for the rest of the party. We also reward experience based on a session's length and average party level.

One of the biggest things that sets us apart is that we have **no PHB+1** rule. Other campaigns limit the number of sourcebooks you can use to the Player's Handbook and one other source text — we allow you to build characters with most published source material and a growing library of third-party content.

# **Importing characters from the Adventurers League (AL)**

To import your character, follow these steps:

- Your **character's level** remains the same, and you start with the minimum required experience for that level.
- Any **items** you've unlocked remain unlocked for purchase with gold, but TCP is *not* converted and must be exchanged for items prior to converting the character.
- Your character starts with **renown** equal to the number of hard-cover chapters and non-introductory modules they have played in.
- Your character is welcomed into the **alliance** which includes your faction. Please see our Alliances guide for more information.
- You can keep a record of your previous AL **logs** and start a new OoC log with a line for imported rewards.

**Some important rules:**

- You can only import a character once. If you continue to play the original character in AL modules, the OoC-converted character does not gain any rewards from these additional AL-ran games.
- When importing a character from Tier 2 or higher, you may rebuild the character once. This must be done before the character is played in their third OoC session.

# **Importing characters from other Shared Campaigns**

Character imports from other shared campaigns must be approved by the council, at which point an admin or moderator can discuss how your module rewards transfer.
