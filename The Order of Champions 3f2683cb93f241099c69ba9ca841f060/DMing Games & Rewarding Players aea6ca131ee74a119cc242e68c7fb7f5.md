# DMing Games & Rewarding Players

# Before the Session

Before beginning a session, a DM should collect basic information about the characters participating in the session. This information should contain:

- The character name and the player's name.
- The level and character classes of the character.
- The race of the character.
- Any unusual physical descriptors for the character. Typical examples include visible scars or tattoos, unusual colorings, missing or extraneous limbs or appendages,any kind of visible aura or spell effect, and demographics such as height, weight, or age, if they are atypical to the generic fit average-sized young adult expectation.
- What alliance/faction the character belongs to.
- Whether or not the character worships a god, and which god.

The DM is free to expound beyond this information. In the case of players arriving late or leaving early, also make a quick note of the time of arrival or departure.

# Rewarding Players

[Basic Rewards - Season 1](DMing%20Games%20&%20Rewarding%20Players%20aea6ca131ee74a119cc242e68c7fb7f5/Basic%20Rewards%20-%20Season%201%207ad76366cab94fa2bb8ed95a16ac619e.csv)

### Basic Rewards (XP, GP, Downtime, and Renown)

*NOTE: These rewards can be modified through the Special Rewards linked below.*

For **Experience Points (XP)**, begin with the maximum allowed per the APL and duration of the module and then deduct as needed for things that were not successfully defeated through combat or roleplay.

*Strict mathematical perfection is not required; if the party completed two-thirds of the adventure and you don't have time to get deep into the minutiae of it, you can simply award two-thirds of the maximum experience reward.*

For **Gold Pieces (GP)**, conversely, begin at zero and award only the treasure earned during the adventure. The vast majority of NPCs guard their wealth vigorously; if a job is not done to their complete satisfaction, they are likely to barter or haggle with the final remuneration. Keep that in mind when determining how much to grant.

*You are also free to charge gold as table conditions require (IE bribes to get away from guards or pay property damage). See the Negative Penalties considerations further down.*

**Downtime** is a constant that is unlikely to change from the standard rewards based on module length, but as DM, you are empowered to reduce or even require the expenditure of downtime equal to the normal reward, based on table conditions.

**Renown** represents the fame and notoriety that your previous adventures have brought you as you head out into the world. For undeclared adventurers, it is merely a statement of personal fame; for those belonging to an Alliance, it also reflects positively on the Alliance as a whole, and can impact what rewards and requisitions are open to them from their Alliance.

## Hardcover Rewards

Hardcover adventures function the same, except that for hardcovers, the Chapter is the base unit upon which rewards are based. In any chapter that contains a combat encounter or significant skill challenge, use the APL of the party to determine the rewards for completing the chapter. For any chapter which contains only "filler" material, use one-half (1/2) of the APL, rounded down, to determine the rewards.

## Magic Items and Unlocks

Magic items are awarded at the end of the module for one-shots and epics and when found for hardcovers. One character obtains the item outright and, for everyone else, the item becomes unlocked for a one-time purchase with gold pieces.

Items obtained outright from modules often have an additional special property; items purchased after being unlocked are the generic version of the item, without this additional property.

Adventures played before item unlocks were formally instituted are not unlocked. This includes adventures played before July 21, 2019, for Order of Champions original characters, and adventures played before Adventurer's League Season 8 for transfer characters from that organization.

## Additional Considerations

**Timing Considerations**. When considering time run, the expected run time of the module should be the standard, regardless of whether the actual game was quicker or slower. However, if players arrive late or leave early, award them only the number of hours played at the table.

**GP Standards**. The GP minimum reward for the adventure is always 0, regardless of APL. The maximum GP stated is the maximum GP per *character*, not per party. Chart applies per chapter for hardcovers. The gold cap is not intended to be a carte blanche to dispense the maximum every time. As a general rule, use the stated gold rewards in the module or hardcover chapter to determine the gold earned, but consider yourself empowered to increase rewards up to the APL maximum if unexpected circumstances at the table warrant it.

**Standard Downtime and Renown**. Regardless of APL, the standard downtime award will be 0 for a 1 hour mission, 5 for a 2 hour mission, 10 for a 4 hour mission, and 25 for an 8 hour mission. The standard renown award will always be 1, unless otherwise specified in the errata of the *Order of Champions Campaign Catalog.*

**Negative Penalties**. A DM is empowered to impose GP, Downtime and Renown penalties up to the maximum possible allowance for the APL; for example, at APL 2, the maximum GP reward is 150 gp, so the DM may instead apply a penalty of up to 150 gp if the situation warrants it (IE if the PCs are captured or convicted of a crime and the money is required to secure their release).This can in no way put any character into debt; if they cannot afford the full penalty, the NPCs involved will always accept what they have as sufficient. [If a DM feels like this is grossly insufficient to the situation, they can petition the Administrators to make an alternate ruling. Similarly, if a player feels that this is grossly unwarranted, they can petition the Administrators to overrule it.]
