# Magic Item Purchasing

14 September 2020

## Purchasing Magic Items

Magic item purchases are made from an Alliance Quartermaster or a magic item vendor in a major city and require ***downtime*** in addition to the item's gold cost. The item must be ***unlocked*** to purchase it.

Most magic items must be unlocked by completing the adventure in which the magic item was found by the party.

The exception to this rule are items offered for sale by the various Alliances; consult the Alliance Guide for more information on this perk of Alliance membership.
