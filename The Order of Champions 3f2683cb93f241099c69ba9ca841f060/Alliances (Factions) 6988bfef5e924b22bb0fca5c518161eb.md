# The Five Alliances

With the rise of travel between worlds like Faerun, Ravnica, Eberron, and more, Alliances have surfaced between prominent Faerunian factions and Ravnican guilds.

## Guild Backgrounds

With the addition of these Alliances, the ten background options found in *Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica* can now be chosen during character creation. Choosing a guild background grants you a Ravnican Guild Emblem.

- **Guild Background Variant (Variant Rule, Click to Expand)**

    **Step 1** Decide which Guild Background you want.

    **Step 2** Pick any 2 Skill Proficiencies.

    **Step 3** Pick either 2 Languages to learn, 2 Tool Proficiencies, or one of each.

    **Step 4** Pick your equipment, usually sticking within the lines of items that backgrounds usually have.

    **Step 5** Now, your background feature and spell list and background title are *linked*. You cannot change out the background feature for something different, nor can you change out the spells in the spell list. They are all a one package deal. Only steps 2-4 can be changed. Everything else is set in stone. The only way to change this is to abandon/change your Alliance, to which then you will lose your guild spells, and be stuck with the  *Alliance Deserter* background feature.

**Ravnican Guild Emblem** (Wondrous Item, Common). An Emblem from one of the Guilds of Ravnica to be worn anywhere on one's person. This emblem allows a character to have guild specific spells added to one's spell list. The spells can be found in the description of the respective guild background. (Note that this magic item DOES NOT count towards one's total magic item count, this item is more symbolic than practical. When you lose this magic item, you no longer have access to guild spells. Any spell on your list removed due to this can be replaced by another level appropriate spell on your class's spell list.)

## Changing Alliances

When you leave an Alliance, you lose all rank and renown you had earned and must start at the lowest rank with zero renown within your new alliance. However, if you have a guild player background and leave or change to a different Alliance, your background will then be changed to the background Alliance Deserter (See below).

### Alliance Deserter (Background)

**Skill Proficiencies**. Same as previous.

**Tool or Language Proficiencies**. Same as previous.

**Equipment**. Same as previous.

**Feature: Shunned**. You've left your Alliance, after previously starting with one of the Guilds of Ravnica. You are shunned by all members of that Alliance, as well as the removal of your *Ravnican Guild Emblem*. Places sponsored by your abandoned Alliance will refuse services to you, and members of the Alliance will scorn you. There is no benefit of this background, only punishment for the deserter. Any Alliance that you join from here on out will be wary of trusting you until you win it through your deeds by becoming rank 4 in an Alliance, to which your deserting nature may be forgiven. *Note: This feature is made to thematically replace the Guildmaster's Guide To Ravnica background to avoid players swapping Alliances and gaining multiple guild background features.*

# Making Your Way Through the Ranks

As a reward for every module you play in the Order of Champions, the final one you receive is Renown, usually one or two per mission. Renown is the way that Alliances rank your position within it, measuring your deeds and feats, as well as your ability to follow instructions given to you. As your renown goes up, so does your rank within the Alliance, as well as the rewards you receive. The ranks and respective renown are displayed below and the general rewards will be discussed below. Specific rewards will be displayed with their respective Alliances later on.

[Alliance Ranks](Alliances%20(Factions)%206988bfef5e924b22bb0fca5c518161eb/Alliance%20Ranks%2037c9353ead5741a284dd6189b5c5512b.csv)

### Rank 1: Initiate

An Initiate is somebody who has just joined their Alliance and is ready and willing for work. Or perhaps it is the rank when you are forced into the Alliance by outside means or an *Alliance Deserter* desperately looking for more work. As an Initiate, you are able to:

***Participate in Alliance Activities.*** Some Alliances have specific safe-houses in cities, as well as a possible contact for help in specific modules.

***Receive Renown.*** Renown means something to you now, as you are now able to build it up to receive more Alliance rewards.

***Receive Alliance Charity.*** Paying for a *Raise Dead* when you're just starting out as an adventurer is hard and sometimes impossible, but your Alliance is willing to help! When your character is in Tier 1 (Levels 1-4), you are eligible for Alliance Charity. Alliance Charity is when an Alliance recovers your body and pays for your revival, if your body is able to be recovered, at the cost of all of the Experience Points, Gold, Downtime Days, and Renown reward of the particular mission that you have unfortunately died on. You can choose to forgo the charity and pay for your own resurrection, given the other members of the party are able to take you to a cleric who can help. This benefit stops being accessible once your character leaves Tier 1.

***Receive Special Alliance Assignments*** Some modules will have Alliances give members a chance to earn extra renown by completing bonus objectives.

***Acquire the Alliance Insignia*** Each Alliance has a specific insignia that marks your membership. Some are subtle, some are a badge of honor. It's up to you to decide!

### Rank 2: Agent

Agents are members who have been with the Alliance long enough to be trusted with the  responsibility for more complex tasks, as well as show their dedication to it. Agents can:

***Participate in a Mentor's Apprenticeship*** Agents are now allowed to become apprentices to higher rank Mentors. See Apprenticeship below.

***Alliance Tool Proficiency Training*** Access to your Alliance specialty training is now available. Each Alliance has a set of tool kits and/or artisan tools that they can train you in. The cost of each tool training is 125 downtime days and 125 gold.

### Rank 3: Stalwart

The rank of a Stalwart shows dedication and aptitude to make it so far into the Alliance ranks and is also when rewards really start coming in. Stalwarts have:

***Specialized Downtime Activities.*** Sometimes Alliances have special downtime activities specified in various modules or seasons. A Stalwart has open access to such.

***Magic Item Acquisition.*** Alliances will give Stalwarts access to purchase Magic Items at the cost of downtime and gold. Said price will be at half of the average market value of the tier of the magic item. This magic item, however, is not allowed to be traded. Each Alliance has a list of items that are shared between them, shown below, while the Alliance specific magic items will be described later on.

### Rank 4: Mentor

Mentors have soared high up the Alliance ranks, to the point where the Alliance trusts them to teach lower-ranking members the ropes. Mentors are able to:

***Forgiveness.*** Mentors with the Alliance Deserter background will finally get that bad taste out of the Alliance's mouth when they discuss you. You can now pick a new Alliance respective guild background to replace Alliance Deserter.

***Become a Mentor.*** As mentioned in the Agent's section, a Mentor is able to choose Agents as well as Stalwarts to be their apprentices. More details below.

***Become an Alliance Assistant.*** Mentors are allowed to pay for the cost of the Raise Dead, Resurrection, or True Resurrection spells to rescue a fellow Alliance member from the icy grasp of the Astral Plane. This can be done for somebody after a module was completed, even if you were not in their adventuring party. To do such requires Mentors to spend 25 downtime days to retrieve the corpse and deliver it to a city or town or local cleric, and then pay for the spellcasting services themselves. Acolyte background discounts apply, as well as if the Mentor is a cleric or the deceased is a Zealot Barbarian.

### Rank 5: Exemplar

Exemplars have shown the ultimate dedication to the Alliance, and are considered heroes in their  own right. Everyone knows their name. Exemplars are influential to the Alliance itself and give very special benefits to lower ranks, such as:

***Inspiratory Presence*** Exemplars are able to, during a mission, choose a member of their adventuring party who is of a lower rank, but at least an Agent, to receive a single point of in-game inspiration. The point expires at the end of the mission.

# Apprenticeship

Two members of the same Alliance, with the appropriate Alliance Ranks, are able to form a Mentor-Apprentice bond. The mentor must be a Mentor or an Exemplar rank and the apprentice must be at least of Agent Rank.

Mentors can only have one Mentor-Apprentice bond at a time, and vice versa for apprentices. This will persist until one of them dies permanently, the apprentice rises to match the mentor's rank, or they decide to end the bond themselves.

## Mentor and Apprentice Activities

Each member in the bond gains the story reward, "Alliance Mentor (Apprentice Name)" or "Alliance Apprentice (Mentor Name)" and is able to take part in specific Alliance Activities:

***Speedy Trading.*** Magic item trades in a Mentor-Apprentice bond take 10 downtime days instead of the standard 15.

***Assist!*** The intense bond that the apprentice and the mentor share allow them to become more proficient in combat when adventuring together. By spending 5 downtime days, the bonded members can:

- Saving throws made by one member due to the effect of another member's action are made with advantage.
- A member can use the Help action as a bonus action any time they want, this feature is available again upon finishing a short or long rest.
- Neither member acts as cover against ranged attacks made by the other member.

## Apprentice Activities

***Training from the Pros*** Apprentices can learn whatever tool or language proficiency that their mentor knows for 0 gold cost. (125 downtime days still needs to be paid.)

***Tips from the Pros*** Apprentices can gain special insight from their mentors. Spending 5 downtime days before an adventure gives the apprentice advantage on one attack, save, or check roll during that adventure. (Be sure to mention this to your DM before the game starts).

## Mentor Activities

***Insight of the Naive*** Sometimes the lower ranks can give you ideas that you have never thought of. Spending 5 downtime days before an adventure gives the mentor advantage on one attack, save, or check roll during that adventure. (Be sure to mention this to your DM before the game starts).

***Renown as an Expense*** Your fame in your alliance nearly exceeds that of the founders themselves. By spending 30 downtime days, you can receive 1 renown. This can only be done once per character.

***They Grow Up So Fast*** As your apprentice grows in strength, as does your respective fame and renown in the Alliance. Every time your apprentice tiers up, (Hitting level 5, 11, and 17), you gain one renown.
