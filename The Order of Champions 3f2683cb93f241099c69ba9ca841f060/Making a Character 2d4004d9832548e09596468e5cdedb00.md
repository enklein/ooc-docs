# Making a Character

Learn how to make a character for play in the Order of Champions.

There are a few basic guidelines we follow for character creation, but if you're new to creating D&D characters, remember our guidelines as you follow the first chapter of the Player's Handbook or the [Creating a Character](https://www.dndbeyond.com/essentials/creating-a-character) page on D&DBeyond.

# **Steps to Making a Character**

All new characters start at level one. You can store your original character sheet as a pdf, with an app, on a printed sheet, and online with Roll20 or D&DBeyond. Some DM's may ask you to import your character into a certain source to play in their games.

Follow these steps to make your character:

1. **Choose a Race.** We have tons of options you can pick from. See further down for our list of allowed sources.
2. **Choose a Class.** Just like with races, there are several classes you can use — and, yes, multi-classing is allowed as you level up.
3. **Get Ability Scores.** No rolling needed, we use either the standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) or you can use the 27-point-buy method under Variant: Customizing Ability Scores in the PHB. If you're unfamiliar with how this works, check out the [Variant rule online](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#VariantCustomizingAbilityScores) or use a [point-buy calculator](https://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html).
4. **Work out your Background.** This includes your character's [description](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#PersonalityandBackground), alignment, and lifestyle, as well as a background from the allowed resources. You can [create your](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#PersonalityandBackground) background as long as the feature and items come from an existing background. When selecting an Alignment, you may use any except for Neutral Evil and Chaotic Evil.
5. **Choose an Alliance (Optional).** In the OoC, canon factions have aligned with out-of-this-world groups like Ravnica's guilds. We recommend joining an alliance, and you can find out which Alliance best suits you in our Alliances guide.

6. **Grab your equipment.** You start with the equipment and gold provided by your class and background.
7. **Start a Log**. Players must keep a log for any OoC character with a record of your sessions played, character rewards, and any items unlocked by that character. Read more about it in our guide to Logging for Players.

# **Character Advancement**

Your character will earn rewards at the end of each session, provided by your DM. Characters usually earn experience, gold, downtime, renown, item unlocks, and often magic items.

Read more about keeping track of these rewards in our Character Logs & Rewards guide and about unlocking and purchasing items in our Downtime Guide.
